note weird error second line second memcpy chunck
1. There would be N floating operations. This is because each element from both arrays must be
	added so the addition of the first element would be 1 floating point operation and the
	addition of the nth element from both vectors would be n floating point operations. 

2. 2*N. This is because global memory is read for every element of both vectors so if vector1 
	has N reads and vector2 has N reads then reading from both will result in N+N or 2N
	reads.

3. N writes. After reading 2N elements adding them for each pair being added one element has 
	to be written to vector3.

4. 4*N bytes

5.
